# pt-search

Fast project-wide search using the platinum searcher.

## Requirements

In order to use `pt-search` you need to install `the platinum searcher` to your system.

## Installation

- Download and install [the platinum searcher](https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher).
- Install this package via `apm install pt-search`
- Set path of `pt` executable in `pt-search` settings

## Usage

Mac: <kbd>cmd-alt-shift-F</kbd>  
Windows, Linux: <kbd>ctrl-alt-shift-F</kbd>

The shortcut invokes the command `pt-search:pt`, which opens the *Find in Project (with pt)* window, where you can find patterns in your whole project using the platinum searcher.

## Acknowlegdements

The rudimentary code is used from the excellent Atom package [https://github.com/antelle/atom-codesearch](https://github.com/antelle/atom-codesearch), which has been adapted for usage of `pt`.
